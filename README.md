# Wireless-Ignition-System

This project demonstrates a safe and controlled method to ignite a matchstick using:
- **ESP32** for Bluetooth control
- **Relay Module** for switching high-current loads
- **Transistor** as a signal amplifier
- **Nichrome wire / steel wool** as the igniter
- **Battery power** for heating

Controlled via Bluetooth, this project uses a relay to deliver power to a heating wire, which in turn ignites a matchstick.
